# Decent Espresso Control

> **Official open-source software by Decent Espresso Ltd.** This application is provided under the GPL-3.0 license. While we strive for quality, please use responsibly and see the [Legal Disclaimer](#legal-disclaimer) below for important safety information.

A fully-functional mobile web application for controlling Decent espresso machines via Bluetooth. This app provides comprehensive control over all machine functions, real-time data visualization, recipe management, shot history tracking, and advanced analytics.

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Limitations

### Browser Compatibility
**Web Bluetooth API has LIMITED support across browsers:**

✅ **Supported:**
- Chrome/Chromium 56+ on **Windows, Linux, macOS**
- Chrome on **Android**
- Edge 79+ on **Windows, Linux, macOS**

❌ **NOT Supported:**
- **Safari (all platforms)** - Safari does not implement Web Bluetooth API
- **iOS browsers (all)** - iOS does not allow Web Bluetooth, even in Chrome
- **Firefox** - No Web Bluetooth support
- **Mac Chrome** - May have limited/unreliable Bluetooth support depending on macOS version

**If you're on iOS or Safari:** You must use the official Decent Espresso app or switch to Android/Windows.

### Tea Brewing Profiles
Tea profiles may have **duration limitations** imposed by machine firmware:
- ⚠️ Tea profiles might run for **30 seconds maximum** regardless of configured duration
- This appears to be a firmware limitation for flow-only (pressure=0) profiles
- **Workaround**: Use manual mode or investigate firmware tea-specific modes
- Currently investigating the protocol for extended tea brewing cycles

### Real-Time Joystick Control
The joystick control interface for real-time pressure/flow adjustment:
- ⚠️ **May not function** without specific firmware support
- Uses Memory-Mapped Register (MMR) protocol which may not be enabled on all firmware versions
- If the joystick doesn't affect brewing, this is likely a firmware limitation
- Designed for compatible firmware versions that support live parameter updates

### Profile Transfer
- Profile encoding follows the official Decent protocol specification
- Enhanced debug logging has been added to diagnose transfer issues
- Check browser console for detailed frame encoding information

### State Management

The app uses Zustand for state management with four main stores:

- **connectionStore**: Bluetooth connection status
- **machineStore**: Machine state and settings
- **recipeStore**: Recipe management
- **shotStore**: Shot history and active recording

### Data Persistence

- IndexedDB for local storage (via idb library)
- Three object stores: recipes, shots, settings
- Automatic data synchronization

## Known Limitations

### Bluetooth Communication

- The current implementation uses placeholder Bluetooth UUIDs
- Actual Decent machine protocol implementation required
- Data parsing needs to match Decent's binary format

### Missing Features

- Profile step editor UI (currently uses default profile)
- Advanced shot profiling with pressure/flow ramping
- Real machine protocol integration
- Firmware updates via app
- Multiple machine support

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Advanced profile editor with visual flow designer
- [ ] Cloud sync for recipes and data
- [ ] Social features (share recipes)
- [ ] Statistics and analytics dashboard
- [ ] Machine maintenance reminders
- [ ] Automatic shot photography
